# Quantum Sudoku Solver

## Educational Demonstration of Quantum Computing for Constraint Satisfaction

---

## Overview

This implementation demonstrates how quantum computing principles, specifically **Grover's algorithm**, can be applied to solving Sudoku puzzles. While this is an educational demonstration, it reveals important insights about when quantum computers provide advantages over classical algorithms.

---

## Key Insight

**Sudoku is actually better solved classically!**

This implementation demonstrates an important lesson in quantum computing: quantum algorithms don't always win. Classical backtracking with constraint propagation exploits the structure of Sudoku more efficiently than quantum search.

### When Quantum Helps:
- ✅ Unstructured search (no patterns to exploit)
- ✅ Massive search spaces (>> 10^20)
- ✅ No efficient classical algorithm exists

### When Classical Wins:
- ✅ Structured problems (like Sudoku)
- ✅ Good heuristics available
- ✅ Constraint propagation possible

## Installation

### Requirements:

```bash
# Core dependencies (required)
pip install numpy

# Quantum computing (optional - for full quantum circuits)
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer

# Visualization (optional)
pip install matplotlib
```

### Quick Start:

```bash
python quantum_sudoku_solver.py
```

The code works with or without Qiskit - it falls back to classical simulation if Qiskit is not available.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Classical Sudoku Solving (Baseline)

```python
# Classical backtracking
for each empty cell:
    for num in 1..9:
        if valid(num):
            place(num)
            if solve_recursive():
                return True
            backtrack()
```

**Complexity:** O(9^n) worst case, but constraint propagation reduces this dramatically.

### 2. Grover's Algorithm (Quantum Approach)

```
|Initial⟩ = |0⟩  →  H⊗n  →  |Superposition⟩
              ↓
        Grover Iteration (repeat √N times):
              ↓
        1. Oracle: Mark valid solutions
        2. Diffusion: Amplify marked amplitudes
              ↓
        Measurement → Valid solution (high probability)
```

**Complexity:** O(√N) for unstructured search, but overhead makes it impractical for Sudoku.

### 3. Hybrid Approach (This Implementation)

```python
# Combine classical heuristics with quantum-inspired search
1. Classical constraint propagation (reduce search space)
2. Quantum-inspired search for ambiguous cells
3. Classical backtracking for validation
```

**Best of both worlds** - uses quantum concepts educationally while remaining practical.

## Key Components

### `SudokuPuzzle`
Represents a 9×9 Sudoku grid with validation methods.

```python
puzzle = SudokuPuzzle(grid)
puzzle.display()  # Show current state
puzzle.is_valid_placement(row, col, num)  # Check constraints
```

### `QuantumSudokuSolver`
Solves Sudoku using quantum-inspired search.

```python
solver = QuantumSudokuSolver(puzzle)
success = solver.solve_quantum()  # Solve with quantum concepts
```

**Key method:** `create_oracle_for_cell(row, col)`
- Encodes Sudoku constraints as quantum oracle
- Identifies valid numbers for each cell
- Demonstrates oracle construction

### `GroverSudokuSolver`
Theoretical full quantum implementation (educational).

```python
grover = GroverSudokuSolver(puzzle)
grover.calculate_optimal_iterations(num_solutions, search_space)
```

Shows why full quantum Sudoku is impractical:
- Requires 324 qubits (81 cells × 4 qubits each)
- Current hardware: ~100-1000 qubits with noise
- Overhead exceeds benefits for 9×9 grids

## Complexity Comparison

### Search Space:

| Empty Cells | Search Space | Classical Tries | Quantum Iterations |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 10          | 9^10 ≈ 3.5×10^9 | ~millions | ~thousands |
| 30          | 9^30 ≈ 4.2×10^28 | impractical | ~2×10^14 |
| 50          | 9^50 ≈ 5.2×10^47 | impossible | ~7×10^23 |

**But:** Classical constraint propagation reduces effective search space by orders of magnitude!

### Practical Reality:

```
Classical Backtracking + Constraint Propagation:
  • 9×9 Sudoku: < 1 second
  • 16×16 Sudoku: seconds to minutes
  • Exploits problem structure

Quantum (Grover):
  • Needs 324+ qubits
  • Quantum overhead is high
  • Structure not exploited
  • Current hardware insufficient
```

## Quantum Advantage Requirements

Quantum computers provide advantage when:

1. **Unstructured Search**
   - No patterns or heuristics
   - Pure brute force needed
   - Example: Database search, password cracking

2. **Massive Search Space**
   - Classical: O(N) → infeasible
   - Quantum: O(√N) → feasible
   - Need N >> 10^20 for practical advantage

3. **No Better Classical Algorithm**
   - Sudoku has structure → constraint propagation
   - Sorting has structure → comparison-based algorithms
   - Cryptography has no known classical shortcut → quantum wins

## Example Usage

### Basic Solving:

```python
from quantum_sudoku_solver import SudokuPuzzle, QuantumSudokuSolver

# Create puzzle
puzzle_grid = [
    [5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    # ... (9x9 grid with 0 = empty)
]

puzzle = SudokuPuzzle(puzzle_grid)
solver = QuantumSudokuSolver(puzzle)

# Solve
if solver.solve_quantum():
    print("✅ Solved!")
    puzzle.display()
else:
    print("❌ No solution")
```

### Theoretical Analysis:

```python
from quantum_sudoku_solver import GroverSudokuSolver

# Analyze quantum requirements
grover = GroverSudokuSolver(puzzle)

# Calculate optimal iterations
iterations = grover.calculate_optimal_iterations(
    num_solutions=1,
    search_space_size=9**50
)

print(f"Grover iterations needed: {iterations}")
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Quantum Superposition

```
Classical: Cell is 1 OR 2 OR 3 OR ... (hidden but definite)
Quantum:   Cell is (|1⟩ + |2⟩ + ... + |9⟩)/3 (genuinely superposed)
```

### 2. Quantum Measurement

```
Before: |ψ⟩ = Σ αᵢ|i⟩  (superposition of all possibilities)
After:  |ψ⟩ = |k⟩      (collapsed to single outcome)
```

### 3. Quantum Oracle

```
Oracle marks valid states by phase flip:
  If state is valid:   |ψ⟩ → -|ψ⟩
  If state is invalid: |ψ⟩ → |ψ⟩
```

### 4. Amplitude Amplification

```
After k iterations of (Oracle + Diffusion):
  Valid states: Amplitude ≈ 1 (high probability)
  Invalid states: Amplitude ≈ 0 (low probability)
```

## Limitations & Caveats

### Current Implementation:

✅ **Educationally accurate** - demonstrates quantum concepts correctly
✅ **Pedagogically valuable** - shows when quantum helps/hurts
⚠️ **Not practical for Sudoku** - classical is better
⚠️ **Simplified oracle** - full implementation would be complex

### Quantum Hardware Reality:

- **IBM Quantum:** ~127 qubits (2023), ~1000+ qubits (planned)
- **Google Sycamore:** 53 qubits
- **Error rates:** ~0.1-1% per gate
- **Coherence time:** microseconds to milliseconds

**Sudoku needs:**
- 324+ qubits
- Thousands of gates
- Long coherence times
→ Not feasible on current hardware
